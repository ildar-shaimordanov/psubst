== Psubst'd drive are not mapped ==

On some systems psubst'd drives are not mapped if psubst was run under privileges of regular users. It reguires to be run twice as Administrator and a regular user. See a workaround in issue 4:

  First Run As Admin:
  {{{
  psubst Z: "\\192.168.1.193\raid" /P
  }}}
  That will create the registry entry.

  Then as normal user:
  {{{
  psubst Z: "\\192.168.1.193\raid"
  }}}

== BSOD ==

issue 5 had been created to inform that sometimes usage of the tool led to BSOD. In fact this is not direct influence of different programs each other. Moreover, it may be the specific behaviour of a single program. From the description of the issue we can see that BSOD appears only after applying this script, reboot and login. 

Harald Eiermann said:
  I faced a BSOD when using the script on a system with Trend Micro 10.x virus scan. It worked with Trend Micro virus scanner version 8.x before.

It seems that Trend Micro 10.x has troubles working with permanently subst'd drives. This presumption can be checked by adding manually an entry to the Registry (not using the script) and rebooting/logging in. If BSOD appears again this will be proof of it. 

== LABELING ==

issue 6. Once created a subst'ed drive has the same label and the same total, used and free sizes. This is not bug of the `SUBST`/`PSUBST` tools but feature of Windows when subst'ed drives inherit properties from the original drive. 

They inform that this issue can be solved by adding the certain key to the Windows Registry:

Create the following registry key for changing the drive label 
{{{
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\DriveIcons\X\DefaultLabel 
}}}

Create the following registry key for changing the drive icon
{{{
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\DriveIcons\X\DefaultIcon 
}}}

`X` refers for the real drive letter. Populate the default value in each key with the particular values and restart the system to apply changes.
