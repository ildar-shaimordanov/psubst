## Psubst'd drive are not mapped ##

On some systems psubst'd drives are not mapped if psubst was run under privileges of regular users. It reguires to be run twice as Administrator and a regular user. See a workaround in [issue 4](https://code.google.com/p/psubst/issues/detail?id=4):

> First Run As Admin:
```
  psubst Z: "\\192.168.1.193\raid" /P
```
> That will create the registry entry.

> Then as normal user:
```
  psubst Z: "\\192.168.1.193\raid"
```

## BSOD ##

[issue 5](https://code.google.com/p/psubst/issues/detail?id=5) had been created to inform that sometimes usage of the tool led to BSOD. In fact this is not direct influence of different programs each other. Moreover, it may be the specific behaviour of a single program. From the description of the issue we can see that BSOD appears only after applying this script, reboot and login.

Harald Eiermann said:
> I faced a BSOD when using the script on a system with Trend Micro 10.x virus scan. It worked with Trend Micro virus scanner version 8.x before.

It seems that Trend Micro 10.x has troubles working with permanently subst'd drives. This presumption can be checked by adding manually an entry to the Registry (not using the script) and rebooting/logging in. If BSOD appears again this will be proof of it.

## LABELING ##

[issue 6](https://code.google.com/p/psubst/issues/detail?id=6). Once created a subst'ed drive has the same label and the same total, used and free sizes. This is not bug of the `SUBST`/`PSUBST` tools but feature of Windows when subst'ed drives inherit properties from the original drive.

They inform that this issue can be solved by adding the certain key to the Windows Registry:

Create the following registry key for changing the drive label
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\DriveIcons\X\DefaultLabel 
```

Create the following registry key for changing the drive icon
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\DriveIcons\X\DefaultIcon 
```

`X` refers for the real drive letter. Populate the default value in each key with the particular values and restart the system to apply changes.

It also works without internet connection since it's connecting to localhost. And the only difference i found was that it appears under Network Locations instead of Hard Disk Drives. The only problem might be if you want to map an unsharable location.

## Can't SUBST a path ##
If you try to SUBST a path to the existing drive you will get two different error messages:

The drive `G:` is a physical or logical drive name
```
Invalid parameter - G:
```

The specified drive is a substituted drive
```
Drive already SUBSTed
```

~~The [issue 8](https://code.google.com/p/psubst/issues/detail?id=8) describes this problem. Anyway, you have to specify another name for substituted paths.~~

The real problem with the [issue 8](https://code.google.com/p/psubst/issues/detail?id=8) had to do with another reason that was fixed yet. Anyway, if you meet the messages as described above be sure that your system doesn't use the drive name you want to substitute.

## Map network path with different credential for system account? ##

[Madnik7](http://code.google.com/u/Madnik7@gmail.com/) has asked ([issue 9](https://code.google.com/p/psubst/issues/detail?id=9)):
> can I map network path for system account? The problem is that sytem account does not have access to network resource without especifying a credential.

Commonly, they don't recommend use SUBST for mapping network paths. There is an appropriate tool NET USE. Nevertheless, there is interesting discussion that has to do with this issue (see this forum http://www.dostips.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5258). It is based on the undocumented features of SUBST command given at http://ss64.com/nt/subst.html :

> if a drive is substed using characters other than A-Z ($,#, :, !, 0-9) it will not appear in Windows Explorer or in the drives reported by SUBST.

So we could use the following workaround solution:
```
subst #: \\servername\share
subst Z: #:\
```

## Missing the final parenthesis ) of the path after restart ##

[jpach4](https://code.google.com/u/110168451143980461231/) has informed about the bug when the folder contains final parenthesis ([issue 10](https://code.google.com/p/psubst/issues/detail?id=10)).

This bug has been fixed in the revision [r36](https://code.google.com/p/psubst/source/detail?r=36) and the new version 2.6 is available for downloading from the [FossHub Downloads](http://code.fosshub.com/psubst/downloads) page.

## Peristent needs administrator

~~Sometimes the script fails as it requires to be run as administrator (f.i.: see the [issue 15](https://github.com/ildar-shaimordanov/psubst/issues/15)). The best recommendation is to give the administrative permissions while executing the script.~~

It was fixed by the [Version 3.0.1 Stable](https://github.com/ildar-shaimordanov/psubst/releases/tag/v3.0.1).

## Mapping `A:` or `B:` to a folder on another drive

As it was mentioned in the [issue 16](https://github.com/ildar-shaimordanov/psubst/issues/16), there is trouble in mapping the drives `A:` or `B:` to a folder on another drive. @bourbongoat said that this issue can be solved removing the registry key for the particular drives:

> Deleting the registry key for the b:\ drive will fix it, however. I've also reproduced the issue with the a:\ drive, but others seem to work without issue.

Also!

> **Warning**
> Never map to `A:` or `B:`!

As it is been repeatedly noticed: psubst'ing `A:` or `B:` completely breaks updates in Windows 10 and 11, including security updates. if you have do so, you could get the hardly traceable problem because Microsoft error messages mislead and don't point to psubst.

## Recycle bin feature

In the [issue 18](https://github.com/ildar-shaimordanov/psubst/issues/18) I was asked

> ... add a feature so that the files deleted from the virtual drive go into recycle bin...

It is hardly possible to implement the requested feature in easy way so to make it working automatically.

For those who else wants the same feature I recommend to do it manually following the steps as it's explained in this QA: https://superuser.com/questions/222747/recycle-bin-on-substed-drives. It's not 100% reliable but can be assumed as a workaround solution.
